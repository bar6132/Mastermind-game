# Mastermind Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic board game Mastermind, written in Python.

There is 3 game each on is used with different style :  
		
	game1.py = Pure python code game <Playing in the terminal>
	game2.py = Use the power of tkinter to run the game with some GUI interface <Playing in tkinter>
	game3.py = Use the power of pygame to run the game with some GUI interface and PNG file  <Playing in Pygame PNG file>


## How to Play

    Run the <game1/2/3.py> file using Python.

    The computer will randomly generate a secret code of colored pegs.
    
    Enter your guesses for the code, following the provided format.
    
    Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the code or run out of attempts.


##  How to Run

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
  
    Clone this repository.
  
    Open a terminal or command prompt.
  
    Navigate to the directory where <game1/2/3.py>` is located.
  
    Run the command `python <game1/2/3.py>'

  ## Game Rules

 	The secret code consists of a sequence of colored pegs.

	 Each peg can be one of several colors.

 	The player's objective is to guess the secret code within a limited number of attempts.

	 After each guess, the computer provides feedback in the form of black and white pegs:

   	 A black peg indicates a correct color in the correct position.

    	A white peg indicates a correct color but in the wrong position.

	Use the feedback to deduce the correct code.
